# Ai.exe
### A browser love story

Ai.exe is a visual novel based on the premise of internt browsers. You play Takamura Naoto, a freshman in high school who has pretty anti-social tendencies. One day his computer breaks, which drives him to start attending his classes. As he starts going to class, he encounters three different girls, Kuromi, Elsie, and Mosaic.
